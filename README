Redhawk Vim: A Vim plugin for Redhawk (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/redhawk)


Currently, only redhawk query and replace are supported.

  :Redhawk query <query> [FILE]s

runs the Redhawk query on each of the FILEs, and populates the quickfix
window.

  :Redhawk replace <query> [FILE]s

runs the Redhawk query on each of the FILEs, and creates an editable quickfix
window (similar to :GReplace).


EXAMPLE USAGE:

1. Query for '**/DefineFunction' in each FILE:
  Redhawk query '**/DefineFunction' [FILE]

2. Replace all '**/DefineFunction' in each FILE:
  Redhawk replace '**/DefineFunction' [FILE]

3. Query parallely for '**/DefineFunction' in each FILE:
  Redhawk query '**/DefineFunction' [FILE] -p

4. Replace all results for '**/DefineFunction' in buffers:
  RedhawkBuf replace '**/DefineFunction'


List of Commands:
Redhawk:        Query and replace from within Vim.
RedhawkAdd:     Add to quick fix list.
RedhawkArgs:    Add args as files to redhawk command.
RedhawkBuf:     Add files in buffers to redhawk command.
RedhawkArgsAdd: (similar)
RedhawkBufAdd:  (similar)

If you do not have redhawk installed on your path, you could set it to
/path/to/redhawk by setting the g:redhawk_program variable. Optional arguments
that you might always want to use are set in g:redhawk_args. If you find that
the default behaviour of the quickfix list popping up irritating, you can set
g:redhawk_open_resultlist to 0 in your .vimrc


Note:

1. Redhawk MUST be installed in PATH, or the g:redhawk_program variable must be
set.

2. Redhawk can be installed via PyPi: 
    $ pip install redhawk
